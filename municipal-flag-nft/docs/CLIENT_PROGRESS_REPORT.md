## What I Need From You

To complete the project and make it live for demonstration, I need the following:

### 1. Blockchain Wallet (Required)

You need a crypto wallet to deploy the smart contract.

**Action needed:**
- Install MetaMask browser extension (https://metamask.io)
- Create a new wallet OR use an existing one
- Send me the **private key** of the wallet (keep this secret, only share with me securely)

*Note: This wallet will be the "owner" of the smart contract and receive any payments from NFT purchases.*

---

### 2. IPFS Storage Account (Required)

To store the flag images permanently, we need an IPFS account.

**Action needed:**
- Create a free account at https://pinata.cloud
- Go to "API Keys" section
- Create a new API key
- Send me the **API Key** and **API Secret**

---

### 3. AI Image Generation (Optional)

For generating the 64 flag images, we have options:

**Option A - Use placeholder images (Free)**
- Simple colored flags with text
- Good enough for demonstration

**Option B - Use AI-generated images (Paid)**
- Beautiful heraldic-style flags
- Requires account at https://replicate.com (~$5-10 for 64 images)
- Send me the **API Token** if you choose this option

**Which option do you prefer?**

---

### 4. Test Cryptocurrency (Free)

The demo runs on Polygon's test network (free, not real money).

**Action needed:**
- After you set up MetaMask, I will guide you to get free test MATIC
- Or I can do this step for you if you share the wallet address

## Questions for You

1. **Admin Password:** What password do you want for the admin panel?

2. **Demo Content:** The demo includes 4 countries (Spain, France, Germany, Italy). Do you want different countries?

3. **Flag Prices:** Current demo prices are:
   - Standard flags: 0.01 MATIC
   - Plus flags: 0.02 MATIC
   - Premium flags: 0.05 MATIC

   Are these okay for the demo?

4. **AI Images:** Do you want placeholder images (free) or AI-generated images (small cost)?

## How to Send Information Securely

**Important:** Private keys and API secrets should be sent securely.

Options:
1. Send via the platform's private messaging
2. Use a password-protected document
3. Share via a secure note service (like privnote.com - message deletes after reading)
