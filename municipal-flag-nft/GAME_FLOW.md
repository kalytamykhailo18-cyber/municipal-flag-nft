# Municipal Flag NFT Game - How to Play

This document explains the game flow and mechanics of the Municipal Flag NFT Game.

---

## Game Concept

Collect flags of real municipalities from around the world! Each flag is an AI-generated NFT (using Stable Diffusion), representing a specific location within a municipality. The game combines NFT collecting with social features and a discount reward system.

## Game Structure

### Geographic Hierarchy

```
Country (4 countries)
  └── Region (1 per country)
        └── Municipality (2 per region)
              └── Flags (8 per municipality)
```

**Total: 64 flags** (4 x 1 x 2 x 8)

### What is a Flag?

Each flag represents the **coordinates of a municipality headquarters** - specific locations like:
- Town Hall
- Fire Station
- Bakery
- Bridge
- Library
- School
- Church
- Main Square

The flag image is AI-generated based on that location within the municipality.

## The NFT Pair System

**Every flag has a PAIR of identical NFTs:**

| NFT | Cost | Purpose |
|-----|------|---------|
| **First NFT** | FREE | Shows your interest. Grants access to the social features for that municipality's flags. Multiple users can claim this. |
| **Second NFT** | PAID | Completes the pair. Only ONE person can buy this. Once purchased, the flag is **removed from the game** (closed). |

### How It Works:

```
Flag: "Barcelona - Town Hall Coordinates"

1. Multiple users claim First NFT (FREE)
   → They show interest
   → They gain access to social features for this flag
   → They can see other interested users
   → They can interact with each other

2. ONE user purchases Second NFT (PAID)
   → The pair is completed
   → The flag is CLOSED (removed from the game)
   → No more NFTs can be minted for this flag
```

## Flag Categories & Subscription Discounts

Flags come in three categories. Purchasing them gives discounts on **Standard subscriptions**:

| Category | Price Example | Discount Benefit |
|----------|---------------|------------------|
| **Standard** | 0.01 POL | No discount |
| **Plus** | 0.02 POL | 50% discount on ONE future Standard subscription |
| **Premium** | 0.05 POL | **Permanent 75% discount** on ALL Standard subscriptions |

### Discount Strategy:

```
Best Strategy:

1. Buy a PREMIUM flag first (0.05 POL)
   → You now have PERMANENT 75% discount on Standard

2. All future Standard flags cost 75% less!
   → 0.01 POL becomes 0.0025 POL

Alternative:

1. Buy a PLUS flag (0.02 POL)
   → Get 50% off on ONE Standard purchase only
```
