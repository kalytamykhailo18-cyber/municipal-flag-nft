## He:
This would be the general summary of the project. Let me know if you think it's feasible. It needs to be available by December 10th, without delays. I can send any necessary questions about the project during the following week.
Functional Demonstration of a Municipal Flag NFT Game

Objective:
To develop a functional demonstration (not in production) of a web game based on NFTs, where players collect flags of real municipalities grouped by country and region. Each flag is an AI (Stable Diffusion) generated NFT, with a pair acquisition mechanic and social features such as bids, player interaction, and history.

Game Content:
NFTs per Municipal Flag: Each flag has a pair of identical NFTs.
First unit: Free, can be requested by several users as a sign of interest. Grants access to the social aspect to people interested in flags of a municipality. The social aspect can be simplified.
Second unit: Acquired through purchase and completes the pair (is removed from the game).

Flag Categories:
Standard: No discounts.
Plus: Grants a 50% discount on a future Standard subscription.
Premium: Grants a permanent 75% discount on the Standard subscription.
Country > Region > Municipality: Configurable geographic hierarchy in the administrative panel.
NFT Name: Coordinates of the municipality headquarters to which each flag belongs: fire station, bakery, etc.
Administrative panel configurable by the owner to change the countries, regions, and municipalities that are displayed:
Countries
(4), regions (1 per country), and municipalities (2 per region).

Number of flags per municipality (8).
AI-generated base image.
AI-generated NFT images (Stable Diffusion) from the base image for each municipality.

Social System:
Visualization of interested parties and owners by insignia.
Connection between players.
Off-chain auction for closed flags.
Ranking and reputation.

Blockchain: NFTs on the Polygon network (at a reduced cost).
Instructions:
Developing a Functional Demo
This is not a production product, only a functional demo. The code must be functional, clear, in English, and documented.

Copyright Assignment:
The copyright assignment for the source code and generated materials is required.

Required Technical Documentation:
Technical manual for the application (backend, frontend, contracts).
Graphical system architecture diagram highlighting the main points:
Frontend: React.

Backend: Node.
Smart contracts (ERC-721).
AI: Stable Diffusion.

IPFS for images and metadata.

Step-by-step instructions:
How to set up the backend, frontend, and AI.
How to connect wallets and implement contracts on the testnet.
How to register and change countries, regions, and flags.
How to simulate the buy/bid flow.

Live demo guide:
How to display navigation.
How to claim a flag.
How to close an NFT pair.
How to view rankings and social interactions.
How to change the appearance of the web application on demand.
Step-by-Step Development:
Define the project structure and work environment.

Create the backend (REST API, database, AI integration, interest and closing logic).

Implement AI to generate images from source images.
Connect to IPFS to host images and metadata.
Develop a smart contract (ERC-721 with peer-to-peer logic).
Implement the contract on a testnet (Polygon Mumbai).
Develop the frontend (React) with geographic navigation.

Integrate a wallet (MetaMask) and transaction signing.
Program the logic for discounts by category.
Add a bidding system and social interaction (off-chain).
Test with multiple users and limit conditions.
Prepare a demo script.

## Me:
Hello!
Yes, I think the scope is feasible as a functional demonstration until December 10th, as long as we focus on a lean version:
– ERC-721 contracts in Polygon (testnet), with NFT pair logic, categories (Standard/Plus/Premium) and discounts.
– Backend (I can use Node or Python) with REST API, IPFS integration, interest logic, pair purchase/closing, and simulated off-chain auction/social.
– Frontend in React with navigation by Country > Region > Municipality, MetaMask connection, flag claim/purchase, basic rankings, and a simple panel to manage countries/regions/municipalities/flags.
– Image generation via Stable Diffusion using a simple flow (we can pre-generate the flag set for the demo).
– Complete technical documentation and demo guide, as you described.

I just need to align two points to finalize the planning:

1. Do you prefer a backend in Node (Express) or Python (FastAPI/Flask)?
2. Do you already have the base images for the flags, or should I generate everything from generic AI prompts for the demo?

If you agree with this demo MVP outline, I can organize the schedule to ensure delivery without delays by December 10th.

## He:
I still have some questions about the scope:
Will a safety helmet be used?
Will there be any integration with social networks, or could something be done quickly?
Will it be configured so that the owner can easily switch between the countries, regions, or municipalities shown?
Will the owner be able to easily change the displayed NFTs?
Thank you.
Will a safety helmet be used?
Backend --> python
Will there be any integration with social media, or could something be done quickly? --> I've read that it's possible.

## Me:
Hello,
Great questions, I'll answer point by point:
- Yes, I will use Hardhat as a "security helmet" for development, testing, and deployment of ERC-721 contracts on the Polygon testnet.
- The backend will be in Python (FastAPI), with a REST API and a simple panel so that the owner can easily switch between the countries, regions, and municipalities that appear.
- In this same panel, the owner will also be able to change the displayed NFTs (for example, changing images/metadata within the context of the demonstration).
Regarding social networks, I would focus solely on the game's internal social system (interested parties, owners, ranking, and off-chain auction), without integrating with external networks at this stage, especially since it's just a functional demo.
Instead of integrating with external social networks, we can keep the social layer entirely within the application: list of interested parties, owners, rankings, and off-chain bid history, enough to demonstrate the concept.
As it's a demonstration, my proposal is not to integrate with external social networks now; I'm concentrating on building the internal social system (interactions between players, ranking, and off-chain bids), leaving external integrations for a later phase if it makes sense.
If you agree with these points, I will proceed with this plan to deliver the functional demo by December 10th without delays.

## He:
OK, agreed.
Perfect, I'll need documentation for some of the hard hat tests performed.

## Me:
Thank you for your agreement.
I can begin as soon as you finalize our contract.
I will include in the delivery the documentation for the Hardhat tests: what each test validates, how to run it (`npx hardhat test`), environment prerequisites, and example outputs, so that I can easily reproduce everything.

## He:
Thanks
I'll pay you for testing.
The project must be tested; it cannot be shared in any public repository.
